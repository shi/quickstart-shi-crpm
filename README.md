# AWS Quick Start

Create a CI/CD pipeline that watches itself for changes, and an IDE that can be used to edit the pipeline infrastructure code.

## Getting Started

This isn't an official [AWS Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart) yet, so here's how to use it in the meantime.
The easiest way to launch the quick start, is to do it from an [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9) environment.

1.  Log into the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console) and create a new Cloud9 environment.
2.  Open the new Cloud9 environment once it has been created.
3.  Follow the instructions below.  You will end up with two Cloud9 environments when you are all done, and can delete this first one created in the **Getting Started** section after the second one below, has been created.

## Create Stacks

```bash
# Install dependency
npm i -g typescript

# Install AWS CDK if you don't have it already (you can check with: cdk --version)
npm i -g aws-cdk

# Clone the quick start code and install the CDK app
git clone https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-shi-crpm
cd quickstart-shi-crpm
npm i

# Synthesize the IDE stack CloudFormation template
cdk synth ide

# Copy the CloudFormation template located at cdk.out/ide.template.json into
# some S3 bucket in your account
aws s3 cp cdk.out/ide.template.json s3://BUCKET_NAME/ide.template.json

# Deploy the infrastructure CI/CD stack and the nested IDE stack as well
cdk deploy quickstart --parameters IdeStackTemplateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET_NAME/ide.template.json
```

## Usage

1.  Wait for the above stacks to finish being created.
2.  In the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console), open the newly created [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9) environment.
3.  Then, try changing some property value in any *props.yaml* file in one of the nested directories in *quick-start/res/*. For example, you could change the build server type from **BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL** to **BUILD_GENERAL1_MEDIUM** as seen in the screenshot below. [You can learn more about **crpm** and properties files here](https://shi.github.io/crpm).

4.  On the command line, commit the change and push it to AWS CodeCommit to kick off the AWS CodePipeline as seen in the screenshot below.

5.  In the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console), open the [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline) that was created.  Then, scroll down to the **Review** stage, click the **Review** button, enter a message, and click the **Approve** button as seen in the screenshot below.
    
    *Note: The first time the quick start is launched, the pipeline will run automatically.  You can approve it and let it continue completing, as it will not update anything.*

6.  After the **Deploy** stage has finished, navigate in the console to the resource whose property you changed, and verify that it has changed.

## Destroy Stacks

```bash
# Destroy the infrastructure CI/CD pipeline stack and nested IDE stack
cdk destroy quickstart
```
